Examples of my ESPHome YAMLs

I'm new to the home automation game, but I am trying to adapt it in ways that will work in my home. 

A lot of the code may look familiar, as I pull examples from different sources and them modify them as needed.

Thanks to everyone out there that is publishing their code and doing the leg work! It's greatly appreciated.
